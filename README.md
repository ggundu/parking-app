parking-app
===========

Application Description
-----------------------
This application, parking-app (Park-My-Bike!), is a java based single page application used to find the closest
bike parking locations either from the current location of the User or by input Address. 
Bike Parking Location data is being supplied from https://data.sfgov.org using Socrata API and for now the data is limited to 
SF city only.
Once the results are displayed, by default the application shows the closest parking location Bike Directions but the user can
select any other displayed location and get the directions to the selected location respectively.

UI Frameworks/Technologies Used: Html5, CSS3, Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Geo Location services, Google Maps, Google direction service.
Backend: Java, Spark framework, Socrata/SODA API, Maven build

Interesting pieces in the application are location resolution and the coordinate math to determine the location coordinates to search and
the API integration and the Query language for the SODA API.
